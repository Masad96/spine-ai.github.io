# Open positions


We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

At the moment, we have the following positions open:
* Deadline May 27: [PhD in Scientific Computing with focus on Secure Federated Machine Learning](https://uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/details/?positionId=507539),
* Deadline June 20: [PhD in Automatic Control - Project 1: Secure Learning and Control Systems](http://uu.varbi.com/what:job/jobID:507667/),
* Deadline July 29: [Postdoc in Automatic Control with focus on Secure Learning and Control for Large-Scale Systems](http://uu.varbi.com/what:job/jobID:509082).


[//]: # (Our vision is to develop methodologies for designing intelligent autonomous decision-making systems that are secure and resilient against malicious adversaries.)

You will have the chance to work on basic and applied research at the intersection of cybersecurity, control theory, and machine learning. 

You will take an acive role in determining the important and interesting research questions to tackle, creating novel scientific methodologies and tailoring them for specific practical applications, developing new adversary models and defense mechanisms, and evaluating the proposed methods on experimental setups.


**Note: Sometimes we do not have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. In those periods, we can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. We would be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [VR International Postdoc grant](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/calls/2021-11-17-international-post-doc-grant-within-natural-and-engineering-sciences-spring-call.html) or the [Marie Curie Postdoc fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships).**

State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate.


### Master and Bachelor projects for Uppsala University students
If you are a Master or Bachelor student at Uppsala University looking for a degree project, contact me (or any group member) per email or drop by my office.

### Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Uppsala University, see [the University's website](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/). We may take external master students for a degree project or a short stay on their own funding, if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
