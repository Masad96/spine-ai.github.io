# Open positions



We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

At the moment, we have the following positions open:
[Opening 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/SSF_VR_PD_Spring2022.pdf),
[Opening 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/SSF_PhD_2022_v01.pdf),
[Opening 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/GSCybSec_PhD_2022.pdf).


You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.


**Note: Sometimes we do not have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. In those periods, we can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. We would be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [VR International Postdoc grant](www.vr.se) or the [Marie Curie fellowship](marie).**

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
Applications for fully-funded PhD or Postdoc positions can only be done for a specific advertisement and through the [official application portal](https://uu.varbi.com/). All positions at Uppsala University are advertised at the [university website](https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/jobs/).

Other types of PhD and Postdoc positions may also be possible, for instance through the applicant's own fellowship or scholarship. If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:andre.teixeira@it.uu.se). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate.


### Master and Bachelor projects for Uppsala University students
If you are a Master or Bachelor student at Uppsala University looking for a degree project, contact me (or any group member) per email or drop by my office.

### Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Uppsala University, see [the University's website](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/). We may take external master students for a degree project or a short stay if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
