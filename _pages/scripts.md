# Scripts

These are useful scripts I usually  used in my research. Will try to update the list regularly.

#### ROC curve and enrichment curve plotting
  
  **Purpose:** To evaluate the capability of a virtual screening method in enrichment actives among the pool of actives and inactives.
  
  **Script:** <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/phonglam3103/Cheminformatics/blob/main/Multiple_ROC_AUC_generalized.ipynb"> Google Colab</a>

#### AutoDock Vina batch screening and analysis
  
  **Purpose:** Automate the molecular docking process using AutoDock Vina. The script was written in Bash therefore natively compatible with Linux. For Windows, I recommend installing and setting up a path to cygwin64/bash.exe to implement the script.
