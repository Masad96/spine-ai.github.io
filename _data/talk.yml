- title: "In-silico virtual screening and preliminary in-vitro evaluation of potential Interleukin-33 inhibitors"
  event: "VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center Workshop"
  summary: "This is a part of my undergraduate's thesis in which I applied molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation as an effort to search potential interleukin-33 inhibitors. Additionally, I also developed a preliminary in-vitro method employing fluorescent quenching mechanism to evaluate the binding properties of most potential compounds."
